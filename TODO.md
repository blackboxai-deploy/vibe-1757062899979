# Educational AI System - Implementation Progress

## Project Overview
Building a comprehensive educational AI system with three main modules:
1. Code Evaluation System (10 questions + validation)
2. Code Review System (improvement suggestions)
3. Exam AI System (LaTeX ‚Üí MCQ generation)

## Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: Core Setup & Authentication
- [ ] Create main layout and page structure
- [ ] Implement professor authentication (passcode: 422025)
- [ ] Set up session management
- [ ] Create protected routes for professor features

### Phase 2: Main Interface Components
- [ ] Landing page with system overview
- [ ] Student dashboard interface
- [ ] Professor dashboard interface
- [ ] Navigation and routing setup

### Phase 3: Module 1 - Code Evaluation System
- [ ] Code input interface (manual entry)
- [ ] AI prompt for 10 questions generation
- [ ] Question display with difficulty levels
- [ ] Free-form response collection
- [ ] Context-aware validation system
- [ ] JSON response handling

### Phase 4: Module 2 - Code Review System
- [ ] Code analysis interface
- [ ] Improvement suggestion display
- [ ] External comprehension questions
- [ ] Specification-based recommendations

### Phase 5: Module 3 - Exam AI System
- [ ] LaTeX subject input interface
- [ ] JSON question bank generation
- [ ] Question bank management
- [ ] Randomized MCQ interface
- [ ] Anti-cheating measures (shuffled questions/answers)
- [ ] Skip/Report functionality
- [ ] Scoring system (0-100 scale)

### Phase 6: Professor Features
- [ ] Editable system prompts for all modules
- [ ] Question bank management interface
- [ ] Analytics dashboard
- [ ] System configuration panel

### Phase 7: AI Integration
- [ ] OpenRouter/Claude API integration
- [ ] Temperature setting (0.5)
- [ ] Context preservation
- [ ] Error handling and fallbacks

### Phase 8: Image Processing & Testing
- [ ] **AUTOMATIC**: Process placeholder images (placehold.co URLs) ‚Üí AI-generated images
  - This step executes automatically when placeholders are detected
  - No manual action required - system triggers automatically
  - Ensures all images are ready before testing
- [ ] API testing with curl commands
- [ ] Complete workflow testing
- [ ] Performance validation

### Phase 9: Final Polish
- [ ] Multilingual support (English/French)
- [ ] Responsive design optimization
- [ ] Error handling improvements
- [ ] Documentation and README
